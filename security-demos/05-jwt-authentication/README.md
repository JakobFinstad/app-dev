# Security example #4: JPA Authentication

This is the 5th example in the series on Spring Security.

This example shows how we can configure JSON Web Token Authentication, with users stored in the database (access using JPA).
2. We also include all the functionality from the [second example](../02-authorization): different authorization levels,
   login and logout forms.

The code is based on the video
["Spring Boot + Spring Security + JWT from scratch" by Java Brains](https://youtu.be/X80nJ5T7YpE)
