# Swagger docs example
This is an example project which shows how to add Swagger documentation to a Spring Boot project.

Note: if you watched [YouTube videos on Swagger+Spring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gduKpLW_vdY&t=1022) from "Java Brains" - these videos use an older version of Spring Boot. 
For the latest version to work, you need to add the following line in `application.properties`:
```
spring.mvc.pathmatch.matching-strategy=ant-path-matcher
```

See [this StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70059018/swagger-2-issue-spring-boot) for explanation.
